Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy was last modified on July 23, 2016.

Pugmrks (“Pugmrks,” “we,” or “us”) are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of information that is collected through our mobile app, as well as your choices regarding the collection and use of information.

1. How We Collect and Use Information

We collect the following types of information about you:

Information we collect from you directly:

When you create an account, we may collect your personal information such as your name, email address, mobile phone number and a photo, if you chose to have a photo associated with your account. If you want to track your friend, we may collect you friend's name and mobile phone number.

Geolocation. We collect your unique user identifier and your location through GPS, WiFi, or wireless network triangulation in order to obtain your location for the purposes of providing our Service. If you turn off location sharing, we will not share your location with anyone; however, while you are logged in to your account, we may continue to collect your location information in order to provide the Service (for example to show you your own location). We maintain location information only so long as is reasonable to provide the Service and then delete location data tied to your personal information. We may maintain de-identified location data for a longer period of time in order to analyze aggregate trends and metrics.

We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service and to communicate directly with you, such as to help you locating your family and friends, etc.

Information we receive about you from others:

Social Media. When you interact with our site through various social media, such as when you Like us on Facebook or post a comment to our Facebook page, we may receive information from the social network such as your profile information, profile picture, gender, user name, user ID associated with your social media account, age range, language, country, friends list, and any other information you permit the social network to share with third parties. The data we receive is dependent upon your privacy settings with the social network. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to Pugmrks’s website or Service.

5. Children’s Privacy

Our Service allows parents to keep track of their children’s location on mobile devices. The Service is intended to be used by children under 13 only with significant parental involvement and approval. If a Parent wishes to track a User who is under 13, the Parent must first complete the Parental Consent Form and return it via mail, fax or email. We do not use information collected from the accounts of children under 13 for marketing purposes, or permit our third party partners to collect and use such information for advertising purposes. If you believe that we might have inadvertently collected information from a child under 13 without parental consent, please contact us at support@Pugmrks.com.

We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites or services linked to or from the Service, nor the information or content contained therein. Please remember that when you use a link to go from the Service to another website, our Privacy Policy does not apply to third-party websites or services. Your browsing and interaction on any third-party website or service, including those that have a link on our website, are subject to that third party’s own rules and policies. Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding.

7. Changes to Our Privacy Policy

Pugmrks may, in its sole discretion, modify or update this Privacy Policy from time to time, and so you should review this page periodically. When we change the policy, we will update the ‘last modified’ date at the top of this page.
